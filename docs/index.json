	"content": " Why are there seemingly random runtime.GC() calls in the tests? The answer to this is simple - the design of the package uses CUDA in a particular way: specifically, a CUDA device and context is tied to a VM, instead of at the package level. This means for every VM created, a different CUDA context is created per device per VM. This way all the operations will play nicely with other applications that may be using CUDA (this needs to be stress-tested, however).\nThe CUDA contexts are only destroyed when the VM gets garbage collected (with the help of a finalizer function). In the tests, about 100 VMs get created, and garbage collection for the most part can be considered random. This leads to cases where the GPU runs out of memory as there are too many contexts being used.\nTherefore at the end of any tests that may use GPU, a runtime.GC() call is made to force garbage collection, freeing GPU memories.\nIn production, one is unlikely to start that many VMs, therefore it\u0026rsquo;s not really a problem. If there is, open a ticket on Github, and we\u0026rsquo;ll look into adding a Finish() method for the VMs.\n"

	"content": "The main reason to use Gorgonia is developer comfort. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a Go stack extensively, now you have access to the ability to create production-ready machine learning systems in an environment that you are already familiar and comfortable with.\nML/AI at large is usually split into two stages: the experimental stage where one builds various models, test and retest; and the deployed state where a model after being tested and played with, is deployed. This necessitate different roles like data scientist and data engineer.\nTypically the two phases have different tools: Python/Lua (using Theano, Torch, etc) is commonly used for the experimental stage, and then the model is rewritten in some more performant language like C++ (using dlib, mlpack etc). Of course, nowadays the gap is closing and people frequently share the tools between them. Tensorflow is one such tool that bridges the gap.\nGorgonia aims to do the same, but for the Go environment. Gorgonia is currently fairly performant - its speeds are comparable to Theano\u0026rsquo;s and Tensorflow\u0026rsquo;s CPU implementations. GPU implementations are a bit finnicky to compare due to the heavy cgo tax, but rest assured that this is an area of active improvement.\n"

	"content": "There are two VMs in the current version of Gorgonia:\n TapeMachine LispMachine  They function differently and take different inputs. The TapeMachine is useful for executing expressions that are generally static (that is to say the computation graph does not change). Due to its static nature, the TapeMachine is good for running expressions that are compiled-once-run-many-times (such as linear regression, SVM and the like).\nThe LispMachine on the other hand was designed to take a graph as an input, and executes directly on the nodes of the graph. If the graph change, simply create a new lightweight LispMachine to execute it on. The LispMachine is suitable for tasks such as creating recurrent neural networks without a fixed size.\nPrior to release of Gorgonia, there was a third VM - a stack based VM that is similar to TapeMachine but deals with artificial gradients better. It may see light of day again, once this author has managed to fix all the kinks.\n"

	"content": "Gorgonia performs both symbolic and automatic differentiation. There are subtle differences between the two processes. The author has found that it\u0026rsquo;s best to think of it this way - Automatic differentiation is differentiation that happens at runtime, concurrently with the execution of the graph, while symbolic differentiation is differentiation that happens during the compilation phase.\nRuntime of course, refers to the execution of the expression graph, not the program\u0026rsquo;s actual runtime.\nWith the introduction to the two VMs, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how Gorgonia can perform both symbolic and automatic differentiation. Using the same example as above, the reader should note that there was no differentiation done. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s try with a LispMachine:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;gorgonia.org/gorgonia\u0026#34; ) func main() { g := NewGraph() var x, y, z *Node var err error // define the expression \tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;)) y = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)) z, err = Add(x, y) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } // set initial values then run \tLet(x, 2.0) Let(y, 2.5) // by default, LispMachine performs forward mode and backwards mode execution \tm := NewLispMachine(g) if m.RunAll() != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;z: %v\\n\u0026#34;, z.Value()) xgrad, err := x.Grad() if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;dz/dx: %v\\n\u0026#34;, xgrad) ygrad, err := y.Grad() if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;dz/dy: %v\\n\u0026#34;, ygrad) // Output: \t// z: 4.5 \t// dz/dx: 1 \t// dz/dy: 1 } Of course, Gorgonia also supports the more traditional symbolic differentiation like in Theano:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;gorgonia.org/gorgonia\u0026#34; ) func main() { g := NewGraph() var x, y, z *Node var err error // define the expression \tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;)) y = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)) z, err = Add(x, y) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } // symbolically differentiate z with regards to x and y \t// this adds the gradient nodes to the graph g \tvar grads Nodes grads, err = Grad(z, x, y) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } // create a VM to run the program on \tmachine := NewTapeMachine(g) // set initial values then run \tLet(x, 2.0) Let(y, 2.5) if machine.RunAll() != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;z: %v\\n\u0026#34;, z.Value()) xgrad, err := x.Grad() if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;dz/dx: %v | %v\\n\u0026#34;, xgrad, grads[0]) ygrad, err := y.Grad() if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;dz/dy: %v | %v\\n\u0026#34;, ygrad, grads[1]) // Output: \t// z: 4.5 \t// dz/dx: 1 | 1 :: float64{1} \t// dz/dy: 1 | 1 :: float64{1} } Currently Gorgonia only performs backwards mode automatic differentiation (aka backpropagation), although one may observe the vestiges of an older version which supported forwards mode differentiation in the existence of *dualValue. It may return in the future.\n"

Furthermore, there are some additional requirements:\n CUDA toolkit 9.0 is required. Installing this installs the nvcc compiler which is required to run your code with CUDA. Be sure to follow the post-installation steps go install gorgonia.org/gorgonia/cmd/cudagen. This installs the cudagen program. Running cudagen will generate the relevant CUDA related code for Gorgonia. Note that you will need a folder at src\\gorgonia.org\\gorgonia\\cuda modules\\target The CUDA ops must be manually enabled in your code with the UseCudaFor option. runtime.LockOSThread() must be called in the main function where the VM is running. CUDA requires thread affinity, and therefore the OS thread must be locked.

Additionally, Gorgonia uses dep as its vendoring tool.\nThe current version is 0.8.x\nVersioning We use semver 2.0.0 for our versioning. Before 1.0, Gorgonia\u0026rsquo;s APIs are expected to change quite a bit. API is defined by the exported functions, variables and methods. For the developers\u0026rsquo; sanity, there are minor differences to semver that we will apply prior to version 1.0. They are enumerated below:\n The MINOR number will be incremented every time there is a deletrious break in API. This means any deletion, or any change in function signature or interface methods will lead to a change in MINOR number. Additive changes will NOT change the MINOR version number prior to version 1.0. This means that if new functionality were added that does not break the way you use Gorgonia, there will not be an increment in the MINOR version. There will be an increment in the PATCH version.\n  Go Version Support Gorgonia aims to support 5 versions below the Master branch of Go. This means Gorgonia will support the current released version of Go, and up to 4 previous versions - providing something doesn\u0026rsquo;t break. Where possible a shim will be provided (for things like new sort APIs or math/bits which came out in Go 1.9).\nThe current version of Go is 1.9.2. The earliest version Gorgonia supports is Go 1.6.x.\nDependencies There are very few dependencies that Gorgonia uses - and they\u0026rsquo;re all pretty stable, so as of now there isn\u0026rsquo;t a need for vendoring tools.

	"content": "Gorgonia works by creating a computation graph, and then executing it. Think of it as a programming language, but is limited to mathematical functions, and has no branching capability (no if/then or loops). In fact this is the dominant paradigm that the user should be used to thinking about. The computation graph is an AST.\nMicrosoft\u0026rsquo;s CNTK, with its BrainScript, is perhaps the best at exemplifying the idea that building of a computation graph and running of the computation graphs are different things, and that the user should be in different modes of thoughts when going about them.\nWhilst Gorgonia\u0026rsquo;s implementation doesn\u0026rsquo;t enforce the separation of thought as far as CNTK\u0026rsquo;s BrainScript does, the syntax does help a little bit.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example - say you want to define a math expression z = x + y. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you\u0026rsquo;d do it:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;gorgonia.org/gorgonia\u0026#34; ) func main() { g := NewGraph() var x, y, z *Node var err error // define the expression \tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;)) y = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName(\u0026#34;y\u0026#34;)) z, err = Add(x, y) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } // create a VM to run the program on \tmachine := NewTapeMachine(g) // set initial values then run \tLet(x, 2.0) Let(y, 2.5) if machine.RunAll() != nil { log.Fatal(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v\u0026#34;, z.Value()) // Output: 4.5 } You might note that it\u0026rsquo;s a little more verbose than other packages of similar nature. For example, instead of compiling to a callable function, Gorgonia specifically compiles into a *program which requires a *TapeMachine to run. It also requires manual a Let(...) call.\nThe author would like to contend that this is a Good Thing - to shift one\u0026rsquo;s thinking to a machine-based thinking. It helps a lot in figuring out where things might go wrong.\nAdditionally, there are no support for branching - that is to say there are no conditionals (if/else) or loops. The aim is not to build a Turing-complete computer.\n"

As Dave Cheney famously wrote, cgo is not Go. To use CUDA, cgo is unfortunately required. And to use cgo, plenty of tradeoffs need to be made.\nTherefore the solution was to nestle the CUDA related code in a build tag, cuda. That way by default no cgo is used (well, kind-of - you could still use cblas or blase).\nThe reason for requiring CUDA toolkit 8.0 is because there are many CUDA Compute Capabilities, and generating code for them all would yield a huge binary for no real good reason. Rather, users are encouraged to compile for their specific Compute Capabilities.\nLastly, the reason for requiring an explicit specification to use CUDA for which ops is due to the cost of cgo calls. Additional work is being done currently to implement batched cgo calls, but until that is done, the solution is keyhole \u0026ldquo;upgrade\u0026rdquo; of certain ops\n"
