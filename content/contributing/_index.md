Obviously since you are most probably reading this on Github, Github will form the major part of the workflow for contributing to this package.

## Contributors and Significant Contributors ##
All contributions are welcome. However, there is a new class of contributor, called Significant Contributors. 

A Significant Contributor is one who has shown *deep understanding* of how the library works and/or its environs.  Here are examples of what constitutes a Significant Contribution:

* Wrote significant amounts of documentation pertaining to **why**/the mechanics of particular functions/methods and how the different parts affect one another
* Wrote code, and tests around the more intricately connected parts of Gorgonia
* Wrote code and tests, and have at least 5 pull requests accepted
* Provided expert analysis on parts of the package (for example, you may be a floating point operations expert who optimized one function)
* Answered at least 10 support questions.

Significant Contributors list will be updated once a month (if anyone even uses Gorgonia that is).
