The package is go-gettable: `go get -u gorgonia.org/gorgonia`. Additionally, Gorgonia uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) as its vendoring tool.

The current version is 0.8.x


## Versioning 

We use [semver 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) for our versioning. Before 1.0, Gorgonia's APIs are expected to change quite a bit. API is defined by the exported functions, variables and methods. For the developers' sanity, there are minor differences to semver that we will apply prior to version 1.0. They are enumerated below:

* The MINOR number will be incremented every time there is a deletrious break in API. This means any deletion, or any change in function signature or interface methods will lead to a change in MINOR number. 
* Additive changes will NOT change the MINOR version number prior to version 1.0. This means that if new functionality were added that does not break the way you use Gorgonia, there will not be an increment in the MINOR version. There will be an increment in the PATCH version.  

## Go Version Support ##

Gorgonia aims to support 5 versions below the Master branch of Go. This means Gorgonia will support the current released version of Go, and up to 4 previous versions - providing something doesn't break. Where possible a shim will be provided (for things like new `sort` APIs or `math/bits` which came out in Go 1.9).

The current version of Go is 1.9.2. The earliest version Gorgonia supports is Go 1.6.x. 

## Dependencies ##

There are very few dependencies that Gorgonia uses - and they're all pretty stable, so as of now there isn't a need for vendoring tools. These are the list of external packages that Gorgonia calls, ranked in order of reliance that this package has (subpackages are omitted):

|Package|Used For|Vitality|Notes|Licence|
